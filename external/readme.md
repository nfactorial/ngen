External Folder
===============
The external folder contains any dependency modules that are not a part of the actual library.

Currently this project expects the following projects to reside within this folder:

GoogleTest
==========
https://github.com/google/googletest

The project expects GoogleTest (Version 1.7.0) to reside within external/gtest-1-7.0/

Boost
=====
http://www.boost.org/

Boost version 1.6.0 should reside within external/boost_1_60_0

I may provide a script in the future to ensure dependencies can be automatically installed. However, for now, please
install these manually.
